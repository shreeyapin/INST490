Abstract -
Goals and Objectives: Create a detailed database to help New Carrollton manage and improve its green spaces, focusing on areas that are not official parks.
Current State: We are currently creating our final deliverables for our client
Progress Made: We’ve uploaded our data and began working on visuals and a story map.


Feedback Implementation -
Key Takeaways: It’s important to engage the community and address the needs of neighborhoods that lack green spaces. Taking a trip to the city and taking photographs would be beneficial.
Applying Feedback: We plan on finding some time so that we can take photographs and create a visualization that feels real and tangible for our audience.
Goals and Tasks:
Transform our raw data into meaningful visualizations and a database
Take photographs of the green spaces in the city
Meet with our client further


Project Scope -
Constraints: We have limited access to data
Limitations: There is a lack of current data and pictures, which we’ll have to take on our own


Deliverables- 
Project Database: A database that documents all green spaces in New Carrollton and includes filters so users can interact with it.
Story Maps website: A website that displays important information from the database in a clear, concise, and easy to read format. This is important because it shows the work we’ve done while making it easily understandable to people who aren’t familiar with SQL databases. The Story Maps will have pictures and visuals for users to get a better look at the spaces in the area.
Data Report: An analysis of the current data related to green spaces, looking at its format and relevance.


Outcomes -
Desired Outcomes: Give New Carrollton a useful database that helps them make informed decisions about improving green spaces.
Achieving Outcomes: Our deliverables will provide a clear understanding of community needs and current resources, leading to better planning and enhancements for residents.
